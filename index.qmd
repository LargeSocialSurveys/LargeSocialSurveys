# Large Social Surveys Research Group

The Large Social Surveys Research Group is a mainly sociological (though inclusive of all social science disciplines) group that brings together members interested in engaging in significant social scientific social research with a focus on using large social surveys. The unifying theme of the group is all members use large social surveys to produce quantitative social scientific research.

This website hosts and documents our main activities and findings. Each month the research group meets up to discuss projects, findings, research, and proposals surrounding the work of large social surveys. Less often, we host in person symposiums to showcase research through presentations and feedback in a collaborative process.
