title: "Large Social Survey Symposium 2024"
---

Thanks to generous funding from the RTC, the Large Social Surveys PGR Group are putting on another research symposium on Tuesday, the 27th of May at EFI. We will also have a post-lunchtime keynote address from Lucy Dean, a senior quantitative researcher at ScotCen Social Research. 

We welcome submissions concerning large social survey data from all social scientists and on a range of topics. There is no specific theme for this conference, though work submitted must concern Large Social Survey research.
